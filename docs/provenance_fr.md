### CANFAR Provenance

CANFAR Software is developed and released as a part of the CANFAR team's agile development process:  new
features and patches are tested and released immediately after completion.

The testing process is mostly automated.  Unit tests are run in a continuous integration manner on the
entire software suite when new code arrives in the repository.  Integration and regression testing are
scripted and run in a parallel test environment prior to software release.

Platform and service documentation are coupled with software releases.  Service-specific documentation
can be found at the base URL of the service or by appending /service/doc to the base URL.

CANFAR source code is licensed under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
CANFAR adheres to the licensing statements in any third-party software packages that are used.
