The CANFAR consortium is organized as a network of university nodes that
participate in determining directions and emphasis of the consortium through
membership in the executive committee.

The day-to-day operation of the consortium is coordinated by the management team 
which consists of:

  - Principle investigator (from CANFAR lead institutions)
  - Science coordinator observations
  - Science coordinator simulations
  - Computing &amp; data coordinator
  - Consortium management coordinator

The consortium has an advisory committee that has both scientific and
computational and data expertise representation. Agreements between members
may formalize relations as needed.
