### About
_Nucleosynthesis Grid_ or [NuGrid](http://www.nugridstars.org) is an international collaboration of more than 50 researchers in seven countries, distributed over 12 institutions.The collaboration develops and maintains tools for large scale post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations, and apply these to complete sets of quiescent and explosive nuclear production environments. These data sets and research simulation codes are used applied in many areas of nuclear astrophysics and astronomy.

### Present use of CANFAR services and projects
* NuGrid has developed within CANFAR the _**W**eb-**E**xploration of **N**uGrid **D**ata **I**nteractive_ [WENDI](http://wendi.nugridstars.org), a platform to provide members of the NuGrid collaboration as well as external users analysis and exploration access to the NuGrid data sets
* NuGrid is using the [CANFAR VOspace](http://data.nugridstars.org) for sharing data inside and outside the collaboration, taking advantage of the granular access model _CANFAR VOspace_.

### Research data & software needs
* enhance present capabilities by adding integrated processing capabilities into the _WENDI_ platform
* integrate collaborative tools, such as versioning and collaborative creation and sharing of analysis workflows
